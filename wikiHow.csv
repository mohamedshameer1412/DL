3 Ways to Get Rid of Stress Balls on Your Neck - wikiHow,Use tools.,"Although many people find relief just by massaging the stress ball with their fingers, it's important to play around with different massage techniques to find what works for you. Many people find using a basic tennis ball to be beneficial.[3] To use the tennis ball technique, lie down on the floor and place the tennis ball beneath your neck, at the approximate location of the stress ball. You can also do this leaning against a wall. Adjust your body positioning until you feel a ""good"" pressure at the location of the knot. The tennis ball should not cause pain. Move your neck and body up and down and from side to side, allowing the tennis ball to roll over the stress knot. This helps to release tension from the muscle and loosen the knot. Make sure that your neck is a natural neutral position when using a tennis ball. If you find that your head is hanging down on the ball (which may further stress your muscles), simply place a small book on the floor and the ball on top of that. This brings the ball up to your neck instead of your neck arching or extending to reach the ball on the ground. If you find that a tennis ball is too soft, you can progress to a lacrosse ball, which is more firm and may be more beneficial to those with chronic stress balls or more muscle mass Many stores also sell self-massage tools, such as wooden rollers or foam rollers. These can be used in the same manner as the tennis ball."

One way you can get in, if you're lucky, is to get waved in in case a stunt coordinator isn't able to find a person with the combination of skills and build that you have to do a certain job (for example, if you're four foot five and can climb a mountain). Another way of getting in is to try to get work on a SAG or other union film as an extra for at least three separate days. Get an extras voucher after every day and turn in those three vouchers to make yourself eligible to join a union -- though this still doesn't guarantee that you'll get to join."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Land your first gig.,"If you get lucky, you can land a gig with a great headshot and impressive rsum on a non-union project. But if you want to hit the big leagues and find work on a union project, then you have to obtain a production list from the union you've joined; this will contain all of the local union productions that are shooting near you; you will have to sent the stunt coordinator your headshot, rsum, and a brief letter, and hope to get picked for the job. Even if you don't get picked, the coordinator will have your rsum on file for future gigs. While you're waiting for a call, you should try to get some more experience on (union-only) sets, to get a feel for what the job is like."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be patient.,"You may not land your first gig right away. Or you may get lucky and land your first gig, and then there's the months-long radio silence before you hear from a producer again. That's perfectly natural. This is an extremely hard business to break in to, especially if you don't have any connections, and waiting is part of the game. Though you should continue to put yourself out there, you should be prepared to find other work in the meantime, and to stay motivated to succeed, even if you haven't gotten a gig in a while."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Consider another career in your field.,"Being a stunt man is exciting work, but you may not be able to do it forever, whether you're becoming prone to injury, getting older, or just no longer wanting to be part of a risky profession. If you're tired of being a stunt man or a stunt driver but you've gained a lot of experience, then you don't have to quit your field completely; instead, you can find a way to take a more management-related role while still staying in the stunt world. Here are some other roles you can take on: Stunt rigger: To be a stunt rigger, you should not only be an experienced stunt performer, but you should have an understanding of the mechanics of stunt equipment. You should have safety as your first priority, and will perform a variety of tasks, from testing and tearing down stunt equipment on the set to arranging landing pads for falls and positioning wires and harnesses correctly. Stunt coordinator: This is the head of the stunt department, the person who works closely with the director to create the action sequences in the film, or even to suggest alternative stunt scenarios when it is necessary. The stunt coordinator designs the desired stunts, hires the stunt crew, manages the budget, and makes sure all of the stunts are performed safely. Second unit director: The person in charge of filming the stunt scenes, as opposed to the stunt coordinator, who is responsible for staging the actual stunts. As the second unit director, you will film scenes of the stunt performers in action as well as exterior shots of the scenes which can be used in post-production. Although these directors may have experience in stunt work, then must also be experienced in filming and directing."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Follow directions.,"You may think that your best chance of success comes from showing off, trying to impress the film crew, and boasting about all of your additional skills. Once you've become a veteran stunt man, then sure, you will have more leeway, and you may even be consulted as a stunt coordinator or producer, but when you're trying to get your foot in the door, it's important to be as agreeable as possible. You want to be remembered as someone who is easy to work with. Why? So you can get hired again. When you're following directions, it's important to be polite and reasonable when you interact with the crew. If you genuinely have a question about how a stunt should be performed, ask away, but don't nitpick everything that's happening or slow down the process."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be prepared for long hours.,"Being a stunt person doesn't mean falling out of a helicopter for three takes and then calling it a day. It can mean over 14 hours on a set, working nights, and staying mentally and physically alert throughout the process. This is a full-time job, and once you start landing enough gigs, you must be able to commit to the time that you'll need to succeed in your role. In the beginning, you may be juggling other work along with stunt work, but if you've hit the big leagues, you must be ready to give it your all.[4] This means that you'll need endurance to succeed at the job. If you get winded after an our of fighting or feel ready for a nap after rock climbing for an afternoon, then you need to build up your mental and physical strength."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be prepared to travel.,"If you're a true stunt man, then you won't be spending your life filming within a thirty mile radius of your comfy home, not even if you live in Hollywood, CA. You'll be traveling to the Caribbean to film a jet-skiing sequence. You might find yourself in Peru to shoot a rock climbing scene. You might even be in Germany for a high-speed car chase. This means long hours on airplanes, and needing to get over jet lag before you hit those jet-skiis. Sure, this will be exciting, thrilling work, but you'll need to be prepared for all of the travel it involves.[5] As you get older, all of the traveling may become more difficult because you'll have to find a way to make time for your family, if you have one."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Stay physically strong.,"Most stunt men are at the peak of their careers between their 20s and 40s, which means that you have to stay in the best possible shape during these years. This means not engaging in risky behavior, whether you're on the job or hanging out with friends, and avoiding overindulgence in food or drink, which can wear down your body and make you feel horrible when you show up to work. Eat healthy, get enough rest, and make sure to exercise as often as you can, doing a mixture of cardiovascular and strength training, so you're fit enough to do the job.[6] Another way to stay strong is to continue to brush up on your skills, whether you're practicing karate or swimming. If you want to stay physically strong, then you have to keep your mind strong, too. You can't let the dangers of the job get to you and you have to stay focused and positive if you want to succeed in the long run."
How to Be a Stunt Man: 15 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be a master at risk management.,"Being a stunt man doesn't mean recklessly jumping out of three story windows, playing with fire, or crashing a motorcycle into a tree because you weren't careful. Stunt men have families, drive, and exciting careers, which means that they love what they do and want to stay alive to continue doing it. When you get training on how to fall without hurting yourself, drive without crashing, and swim without drowning, etc, you should heed those words carefully, and not go out of bounds to show off if it means risking your life.[7] A study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago showed that there were 37 fatalities on film or TV sets between 1980-1989 by stunt men and women alone; a study by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) showed that 4,998 of its members were injured between the years of 1982-1986, mostly because of stunts. This is a risky business, and you need to stay rational and focused if you don't want to become a statistic. Something can always go wrong, on the set of a Harry Potter movie, Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double David Holmes was left paralyzed and suffered serious spine injures, after a test run for a flying scene went wrong. He is set to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Even if you don't get hurt while demonstrating reckless behavior, you don't want to develop a reputation for being reckless, or no one will want to work with you. What producer would want the reputation of having a stunt man die or fall to serious injury on his set? You need to work on your risk-management skills, not your risk-taking skills. Being a good stunt man is all about being safe, not risking your life."

4 Ways to Firm Your Breasts - wikiHow,Wear supportive sports bras while you exercise.,"Breasts bounce and stretch with each jump or step. Exercising is a healthy habit for you, but just make sure to wear a fitted sports bra before heading out for a jog. Having the right sports bra will reduce the stress and strain exerted on the breast tissue and chest muscles. Try and stay away from compression bras that flatten your breasts against your chest wall. Compression bras will help reduce the up and down bouncing, but not the side-to-side movements because the bra is treating your breasts as a single moving unit.
